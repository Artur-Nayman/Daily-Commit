# Daily Commit Bot 🤖

❗ This repository was created with one goal:  
until I find a job, this bot will remind everyone about me with a daily commit.

---

🛠 This isn’t gaming the stats — it’s automation I built using Python + GitHub Actions.

---

🤖 Think of this bot as my very own automated personal marketer — tirelessly promoting me 24/7, with no coffee breaks ☕

---

🔍 Check out the code, and if you like it — drop me a message!
