# Daily Commit Bot 🤖

❗ This repository was created with one goal:  
until I find a job, this bot will remind everyone about me with a daily commit.

---

🛠 This isn’t gaming the stats — it’s automation I built using Python + GitHub Actions.

---

🔍 Check out the code, and if you like it — drop me a message!

🧠 By the way, I do more than this — take a look at my [portfolio]([https://yourportfolio.link](https://artur-nayman.github.io/personal-portfolio/)).
